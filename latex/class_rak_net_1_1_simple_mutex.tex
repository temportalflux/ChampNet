\subsection{Detailed Description}
An easy to use mutex. 

I wrote this because the version that comes with Windows is too complicated and requires too much code to use. \begin{DoxyRemark}{Remarks}
Previously I used this everywhere, and in fact for a year or two \hyperlink{namespace_rak_net}{Rak\-Net} was totally threadsafe. While doing profiling, I saw that this function was incredibly slow compared to the blazing performance of everything else, so switched to single producer / consumer everywhere. Now the user thread of \hyperlink{namespace_rak_net}{Rak\-Net} is not threadsafe, but it's 100\-X faster than before.
