\subsection{Detailed Description}
Part of the N\-A\-T punchthrough solution, allowing you to connect to systems by routing through a shared connection. \hyperlink{class_rak_net_1_1_router2}{Router2} routes datagrams between two systems that are not directly connected by using the bandwidth of a third system, to which the other two systems were connected It is of benefit when a fully connected mesh topology is desired, but could not be completely established due to routers and/or firewalls As the system address of a remote system will be the system address of the intermediary, it is necessary to use the \hyperlink{struct_rak_net_1_1_rak_net_g_u_i_d}{Rak\-Net\-G\-U\-I\-D} object to refer to systems, including with other plugins
